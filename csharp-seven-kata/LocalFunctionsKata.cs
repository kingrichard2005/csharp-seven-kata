     * From: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/csharp-7#local-functions
     * Many designs for classes include methods that are called from only one location.
     * These additional private methods keep each method small and focused.
     * However, they can make it harder to understand a class when reading it the first time.
     * These methods must be understood outside of the context of the single calling location.
     *
     * For those designs, local functions enable you to declare methods inside the context of another method.
     * This makes it easier for readers of the class to see that the local method is only called from the context in which is it declared.
     *
     * There are two very common use cases for local functions: public iterator methods and public async methods.
     * Both types of methods generate code that reports errors later than programmers might expect.
     * In the case of iterator methods, any exceptions are observed only when calling code that enumerates the returned sequence.
     * In the case of async methods, any exceptions are only observed when the returned Task is awaited.
