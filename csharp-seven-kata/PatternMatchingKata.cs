     * From: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/csharp-7#pattern-matching
     * Pattern matching is a feature that allows you to implement method dispatch on properties other than the type of an object.
     * You're probably already familiar with method dispatch based on the type of an object.
     * In Object Oriented programming, virtual and override methods provide language syntax to implement method dispatching based on an object's type.
     * Base and Derived classes provide different implementations. Pattern matching expressions extend this concept so that
     * you can easily implement similar dispatch patterns for types and data elements that are not related through an inheritance hierarchy.
     *
     * Pattern matching supports is expressions and switch expressions.
     * Each enables inspecting an object and its properties to determine if that object satisfies the sought pattern. 
     * You use the when keyword to specify additional rules to the pattern.
