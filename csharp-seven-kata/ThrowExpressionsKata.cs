     * From: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/csharp-7#throw-expressions
     * In C#, throw has always been a statement. Because throw is a statement, not an expression, there were C# constructs where you could not use it.
     * These included conditional expressions, null coalescing expressions, and some lambda expressions.
     * The addition of expression-bodied members adds more locations where throw expressions would be useful.
     * So that you can write any of these constructs, C# 7 introduces throw expressions.
     *
     * The syntax is the same as you've always used for throw statements. 
     * The only difference is that now you can place them in new locations, such as in a conditional expression.
