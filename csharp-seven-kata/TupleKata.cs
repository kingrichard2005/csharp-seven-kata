     * From: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/csharp-7#tuples
     * C# provides a rich syntax for classes and structs that is used to explain your design intent.
     * But sometimes that rich syntax requires extra work with minimal benefit.
     * You may often write methods that need a simple structure containing more than one data element.
     * To support these scenarios tuples were added to C#.
     * Tuples are lightweight data structures that contain multiple fields to represent the data members.
     * The fields are not validated, and you cannot define your own methods.

    /*
     * The primary reason for introduction of ValueTuple is performance.
     *
     * Differences between ValueTuple and Tuple:
     *
     *                       [ValueTuple]            [Tuple]
     * Class or structure     struct                  class
     * Mutability             mutable                 immutable
     * Naming members         yes                     no (TBD)
